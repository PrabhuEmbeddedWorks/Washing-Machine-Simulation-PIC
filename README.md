# Washing-Machine-Simulation-PIC
Simulation of an Automatic Washing Machine using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. Developed in Embedded C using MPLAB X IDE and XC8 compiler, and simulated in PicSimLab. The project demonstrates keypad control, LCD interfacing, timer interrupts, state-machine based operation, and safety mechanisms.
